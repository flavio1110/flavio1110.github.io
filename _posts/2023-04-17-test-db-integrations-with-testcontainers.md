Picture this, you have a critical and reasonably complicated piece of logic in your application that is handled in the database. Despite any change on it (or around it), you must have a 100% guarantee that piece continues to work just fine. So, what do you do?

### Back in the ancient days...

Before the "age of containers", the solution would be a variant of the following:

1. Have a database with the schema aligned with the application's version.
2. Ensure your CI tool has access to that database, to run the tests in your CI pipeline.
3. Create a script to arrange the necessary data for the test.
4. Write your testing using the DB.
5. Create a script to revert any DB changes performed by the test, such as inserts, updates, etc.

##### What's the problem with testing with a shared database?

Simply put, it's complex, expensive to maintain, and has many other reasons to fail. For example:

- The DB's schema version is not the same as the application's version you want to test.
- There is a change in the network policy that blocks access to the database.
- Someone's test setup corrupted the data that you expected to have, so you arrange script fails, or the test fails because of missing data.

Because of the cost and flakiness of such tests, in many cases, the **_solution_** was to move logic from DB to the application's code when performance was not a problem, or just manually test it from time to time and hope it doesn't break because of an unforeseen reason (it-never-happened-in-the-last-30-minutes).

### Containers everywhere

With the popularization of containers, not only developing, runnings, and deploying became easier, but also integrating and testing your external dependencies became easier, faster, and more dependable.

We can now effortlessly run not only the regular dependencies, like RDBMSs and Message Brokers, but we can emulate many cloud provider services using tools like [localstack](https://docs.localstack.cloud/overview/).

#### What about testing? Testcontainers to rescue!

> <a href="https://golang.testcontainers.org/" target="_blank">Testcontainers</a> makes it simple to create and clean up container-based dependencies for automated integration/smoke tests. The clean, easy-to-use API enables developers to programmatically define containers that should be run as part of a test and clean up those resources when the test is done.

It supports many popular languages/frameworks like [Go](https://golang.testcontainers.org/), [Java](https://testcontainers.org/), [.NET](https://dotnet.testcontainers.org/), [Rust](https://docs.rs/testcontainers/latest/testcontainers/), and others. You can check the full list on its [official](https://www.testcontainers.org/) site](https://www.testcontainers.org/) and because it's open source, you check out and contribute to it in [its repositories](https://github.com/testcontainers).

#### How to use Testcontainers on integration tests?

For this example, assume that one of the features of your software is to search for users based on a few criteria. Your users are stored in a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database and you query them using [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL). Something like:

```go
func searchPeople(ctx context.Context, db *sql.DB, params searchParams) ([]person, error) {
	query := `select first_name, last_name, city
		 from people
		 where ($1::text is null or first_name = $1)
		   and ($2::text is null or last_name = $2)
		   and ($3::text is null or city = $3)
		 order by first_name asc`

  var people []person

  //Execute query, check errors, populate people variable

  return people, nil
}
```

The search criteria will evolve, by adding new filters or adding new features like pagination. Therefore, we need to make sure that whenever we touch this query its existing behavior is not broken. Let's write a test for it using Testcontainers.

### Writing the test

To be able to run these tests against a real database, we need to:

1. Start the DB
2. Create the schema
3. Insert the necessary data for that tests
4. Run the actual test
5. Stop the DB.

Let's see in detail how to perform each one of these steps.

#### 1. Start the DB

Let's create a function that will start a DB, return its connection string and a function to terminate it when we are done.

```go
func startTestDB(ctx context.Context) (string, func(t *testing.T), error) {
	var envVars = map[string]string{
		"POSTGRES_USER":     "user",
		"POSTGRES_PASSWORD": "super-secret",
		"POSTGRES_DB":       "people",
		"PORT":              "5432/tcp",
	}

	getConnString := func(host string, port nat.Port) string {
		return fmt.Sprintf("postgres://%s:%s@%s:%s/%s?sslmode=disable",
			envVars["POSTGRES_USER"],
			envVars["POSTGRES_PASSWORD"],
			host,
			port.Port(),
			envVars["POSTGRES_DB"])
	}

	req := testcontainers.ContainerRequest{
		Image:        "postgres:14",
		ExposedPorts: []string{envVars["PORT"]},
		Env:          envVars,
		WaitingFor:   wait.ForSQL(nat.Port(envVars["PORT"]), "pgx", getConnString).
      WithStartupTimeout(time.Second * 15),
	}
	pgC, err := testcontainers.GenericContainer(ctx, testcontainers.GenericContainerRequest{
		ContainerRequest: req,
		Started:          true,
	})
	if err != nil {
		return "", nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to start db container :%w", err)
	}
	port, err := pgC.MappedPort(ctx, "5432/tcp")
	if err != nil {
		return "", nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to get mapped port :%w", err)
	}
	host, err := pgC.Host(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		return "", nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to get host :%w", err)
	}

	connString := fmt.Sprintf("postgres://%s:%s@%s:%d/%s?sslmode=disable",
		envVars["POSTGRES_USER"],
		envVars["POSTGRES_PASSWORD"],
		host,
		port.Int(),
		envVars["POSTGRES_DB"])

	terminate := func(t *testing.T) {
		if err := pgC.Terminate(ctx); err != nil {
			t.Fatalf("failed to terminate container: %s", err.Error())
		}
	}
	return connString, terminate, nil
}
```

The code above is self-explanatory if you are familiar with Go, but there are a few aspects that I'd like to highlight:
