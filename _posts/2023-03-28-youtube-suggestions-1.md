We live in an unprecedented era in which we can learn pretty much anything we want for free (_or paying very little depending on how much patience you have with ads_).

YouTube is undoubtedly one of the best sources of free content. The only challenge is really to find good channels where you learn stuff and have a good time while doing it.

This is the first issue of a series of posts in which I'm going to recommend three channels with excellent videos.

## TechWorld with Nana

[YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TechWorldwithNana){:target="_blank"} | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Njuchi_){:target="\_blank"}

This is my favorite channel for DevOps-related topics. Nana's didactics and real-world examples help a lot to get to know new topics or deep dive into a specific subject.
This 4-hour long k8s full course is just one of many others. [Check it out](https://www.youtube.com/@TechWorldwithNana){:target="\_blank"}.

## Matt Pocock

[YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@mattpocockuk){:target="\_blank"} | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mattpocockuk){:target="\_blank"}

Advanced TypeScript wizardry, plus on-the-day updates from the latest TypeScript releases (and other open-source loveliness). [Check it out](https://www.youtube.com/@mattpocockuk){:target="\_blank"}

## Fireship

[YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship){:target="\_blank"} | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fireship_dev){:target="\_blank"}

The Gateway Drug for developers. This is how the channel describes itself. ðŸ˜…

The super funny weekly code report and the 100 seconds pills of knowledge about many different things are very informative and entertaining. [Check it out](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship){:target="\_blank"}.
