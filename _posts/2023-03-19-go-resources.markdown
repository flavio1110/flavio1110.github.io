Below a list of compiled links for whoever is learning Go or want to keep up to date.

### Official docs

- Effective Go - [https://go.dev/doc/effective_go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go)
  - A document that gives tips for writing clear, idiomatic Go code. A must-read for any new Go programmer. It augments the tour and the language specification, both of which should be read first.
- Go Code Review Comments [https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComment](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComment)
  - This page collects common comments made during reviews of Go code, so that a single detailed explanation can be referred to by shorthands. This is a laundry list of common mistakes, not a comprehensive style guide. You can view this as a supplement to Effective Go.
- Go Docs - [https://go.dev/doc/](https://go.dev/doc/)
  - Root for many useful documentations
- FAQ - [https://go.dev/doc/faq](https://go.dev/doc/faq)
  - Answers to common questions about Go.

### Blogs

- Dave Cheney - [https://dave.cheney.net/](https://dave.cheney.net/)
  - Specially the [practical go section](https://dave.cheney.net/practical-go), it has TONS of good advice and real-world examples of how to deal with daily challenges. I highly recommend it.

### Courses

- The way to go - [https://www.educative.io/courses/the-way-to-go](https://www.educative.io/courses/the-way-to-go)

  - It's a course from educative.io, it goes from the basics concepts of the language to more advanced ones. It also brings very interesting insights into the differences between the approaches of Java/C# to Go.
  - It has many challenges in exercises you can do directly in the browser. I found it excellent because I didn't need to have any thing installed and I managed to do it in anything that has a browser.

- How to code in go - [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-code-in-go](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-code-in-go)
  - A great collection of tutorials that cover basic Go concepts, ideal for beginers

### Videos

- Go in 100 seconds - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=446E-r0rXHI&t=38s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=446E-r0rXHI&t=38s)

- Simplicity is complicated - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFejpH_tAHM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFejpH_tAHM)
  - Rob Pike talks about how Go is often described as a simple language. It is not, it just seems that way. Rob explains how Go's simplicity hides a great deal of complexity, and that both the simplicity and complexity are part of the design.
- Concurrency is not parallelism - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmg1CF3gZQ0&t=1582s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmg1CF3gZQ0&t=1582s)

  - Channels provide a simple mechanism for goroutines to communicate, and a powerful construct to build sophisticated concurrency patterns. We will delve into the inner workings of channels and channel operations, including how they're supported by the runtime scheduler and memory
- Concurrency in Go - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_uQgGS_VIXM&list=PLsc-VaxfZl4do3Etp_xQ0aQBoC-x5BIgJ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQgGS_VIXM&list=PLsc-VaxfZl4do3Etp_xQ0aQBoC-x5BIgJ)
