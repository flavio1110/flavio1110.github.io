Below a living list of compiled links for whoever is learning **Go**.

### Official docs

- **Effective Go** - <https://go.dev/doc/effective_go>
  - A document that gives tips for writing clear, idiomatic Go code. A must-read for any new Go programmer. It augments the tour and the language specification, both of which should be read first.
- **Go Code Review Comments** <https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComment>
  - This page collects common comments made during reviews of Go code, so that a single detailed explanation can be referred to by shorthands. This is a laundry list of common mistakes, not a comprehensive style guide. You can view this as a supplement to Effective Go.
- **Go Docs** - <https://go.dev/doc/>
  - Root for many useful documentations
- **FAQ** - <https://go.dev/doc/faq>
  - Answers to common questions about Go.

### Blogs

- **Dave Cheney** - <https://dave.cheney.net/>
  - Specially the [practical go section](https://dave.cheney.net/practical-go), it has TONS of good advice and real-world examples of how to deal with daily challenges. I highly recommend it.

### Courses

- **The way to go** - <https://www.educative.io/courses/the-way-to-go>

  - It's a course from educative.io, it goes from the basics concepts of the language to more advanced ones. It also brings very interesting insights into the differences between the approaches of Java/C# to Go..

  - Short introduction about Go
- **Simplicity is complicated** - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFejpH_tAHM>
