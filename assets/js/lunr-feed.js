Therefore, if you need to deal with fixed-point precision there are two main options:\n\n\n  Use an external package like decimal, which introduces the decimal type. However, the current version (1.3.1), can ‚Äúonly‚Äù represent numbers with a maximum of 2^31 digits after the decimal point.\n  Use int64 to store and deal with these numbers. For e.g. given you need 6 precision digits, therefore 79.23, 23.00, and 54.123456, become respectively 79230000, 23000000, and 54123456.\n\n\nThere is an open proposal to add decimal float types (IEEE 754-2008) in the std lib. However, for now, it‚Äôs just a proposal being discussed, without guarantee it will be ever added.\n",
